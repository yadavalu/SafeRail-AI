# SafeRail AI

Keep Your Communication Secure and Professional

## What is SafeRail AI

### Problem

Security and Compliance Breaches cost Companies Millions in Legal and Reputational Damages, and spend thousands per employee to protect form this.

74% of the Issues don't originate from outside, but from Human Error. For fact 1 in 20 emails contains compliance Risk. 

Although there are sophisticated cyber security tools, human risk is largely un accounted for, and handled by slow auditing processes after the mistake has happened. 

### Solution

SafeRail screens where breaches occur, where employees communicate and submit data, from outbound emails, slack messages to inputs in llms. As text is typed, it is evaluated in real-time by a context-aware AI rule engine. This ensures sensitive data, regulatory obligations, and internal policies are consistently upheld.

If the System detects risk it notifies the employee before the mistake is finalised, making them aware of the issue and offering an Compliant Rewrite. Essentially, like a Security and Compliance Consultant at your Fingertips.
